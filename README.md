# MyWebPage2

This is just a webpage to display my projects and activities. Hopefully in the future, I will actually have a cool project to show :P. 
Right now, I just have small programs. By the way, the reason it is called MyWebPage2 is that my first webpage was not very organized, so I started over.

##Home Page
An introduction about me (Where I'm from, what I learned, etc).

##Projects
All the programs I wrote and the links to the source code on GitHub.

##Experience
My internships and work experience.

##Activities
The activities I have been involved in.

		<p>I made some fun projects in the courses I took at UCI, as well as some projects I made on my own. I posted them
		on GitHub. <br>

		<p>This is a simple 2D shooting game that I made using Python. The code was originally used 
			for an assignment for one of my classes to make an animated simulation. After I finished that assignment, 
			I adapted the code to make my game.</p>

		<p>This was the final project for my ICS 32 class, and I built the program from scratch using python(the professor showed us 
			similar examples during his lectures to help us). I first had to implement the game logic before I could start with the graphics. 
			To do that, I used a 2D array to represent the board, with each element representing a piece or an empty space. I also had to 
			check for invalid moves and prevent them from happening. Afterwards, I got to implement the graphics (I used tkinter),
			and the 2d array was used as a model to draw the game board.</p>

		<p>I have been running for three years. I ran for the team in high school. I was in varsity my junior and senior year, 
			though I was just decent. My best 5k time was 17:38, and my best mile time is 4:58. There are a lot of athletes 
			that are faster than that. I was the team captain in my senior year. I led the team in warm-ups and motivated new
			athletes. Now, I am trying out other activities, like swimming and weight lifting. I still run, 
			but not as often as I did in high school. If I decide to join the running club, then I may start training for races again.</p>

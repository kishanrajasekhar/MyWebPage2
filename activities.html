		<h2>Lab Tutor</h2>
		<p>I was a tutor for the introductory computer science class (ICS 31) during the winter quarter of 2015 (January to March). I worked three days a week (2 hours each day) for ten weeks, and I helped about 5-8 students a session.  The students were learning python, and most of them were in other majors and took this class and a g-ed. Since these students never programmed before, 
			I had to clearly explain technical concepts to them (primitive data types, operators, etc) and really motivate them. 
			It was a fun experience, and I may do it again.</p>
		
		<h2>Cross Country</h2>
		<p>I have been running for three years. I ran for the team in high school. I was in varsity my junior and senior year, 
			though I was just decent. My best 5k time was 17:38, and my best mile time is 4:58. There are a lot of athletes 
			that are faster than that. Now, I am trying out other activities, like swimming and weight lifting. I still run, 
			but not as often as I did in high school. If I decide to join the running club, then I may start training for races again.</p>

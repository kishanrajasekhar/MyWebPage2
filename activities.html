		<p class="SectionTitles">Lab Tutor: Programming with Software Libraries (January-March 2016)</p>
		<p>I was a tutor for ICS 32. In this course, the students use methods from the python standard 
			library, such as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/filesys.html">pathlib</a> for file and directory 
			access and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipc.html">sockets</a> for communcation and networking with
			servers. I clarify the instructions for the students and give suggestions on how to begin the assignment. 
			I also help them with debugging by reading through their code and explaining my thought process 
			on how to approach the problem.</p>
			
		<p class="SectionTitles">Lab Tutor: Introduction to Computer Science (January - March 2015)</p>
		<p>I was a tutor for the introductory computer science class (ICS 31) during the winter quarter of 2015 (January to March). I worked three days a week (2 hours each day) for ten weeks, and I helped about 5-8 students a session.  The students were learning python, and most of them were in other majors and took this class and a g-ed. Since these students never programmed before, 
			I had to clearly explain technical concepts to them (primitive data types, operators, etc) and really motivate them. 
			It was a fun experience, and I may do it again.</p>
		
		<p class="SectionTitles">Cross Country (2011-2013)</p>
		<p>I have been running for three years. I ran for the team in high school. I was in varsity my junior and senior year, 
			though I was just decent. My best 5k time was 17:38, and my best mile time is 4:58. There are a lot of athletes 
			that are faster than that. I was the team captain in my senior year. I led the team in warm-ups and motivated new
			athletes. Now, I am trying out other activities, like swimming and weight lifting. I still run, 
			but not as often as I did in high school. If I decide to join the running club, then I may start training for races again.</p>
